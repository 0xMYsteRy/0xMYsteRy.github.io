<p>A sigma male is a man within the socio sexual hierarchy who chooses to live his life outside of the normal social dominance hierarchy structures of society. Sigma males share many traits in common with the alpha archetype, though their tendency to walk outside of the lines of traditional social dominance hierarchies sets them apart and makes them different. </p>

<li>It is not so supprised that most people are unaware of the sigma male.</li>
<li>They are the one who stay behind the scenes, never show off and work quietly to make things happen.</li>
<li>Sigma males rarely get credits for their contribution since they are not looking for it or do not feel the need to care about it.</li>
<li>It is only when something goes wrong someone might notice them. When everything going smoothly, they are just in the background doing what needs to be done without complaint or fanfare.</li>
<li>Yet no one knows who these quite heroes really are until disaster strike and silence becomes betrayal.</li>
